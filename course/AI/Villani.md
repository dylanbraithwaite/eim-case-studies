# For a Meaningful Artificial Intelligence

### A discussion on the AI mission assigned to Fields Medalist Cédric Villani

Fields Medalist Cédric Villani is currently working for the French Parliament and was recently assigned a mission by the Prime Minister Édouard Philippe to set up a French and European strategy for artificial intelligence. The mission was dated from 8th September 2017 to 8th March 2018. A document entitled 'For a Meaningful Artificial Intelligence' describes the findings of the mission.

Villani gives a foreword to the document summarising his thoughts on being asked to head the mission. He makes it clear that AI is becoming a vastly important part of modern society, and that it is relevant to mathematicians like himself, for example his research on optimal transport has been cited in articles about AI.

Whilst France is at the forefront of worldwide exploration on mathematics and AI, the report
recognises that the country's scientific progress does not always translate into concrete industrial and economic applications. Therefore a lot of the document focusses on how to make France a key player in AI in this manner. Part of their plan is to improve the resources available to researchers by setting up a supercomputer exclusively for AI, to make public research careers more attractive and change the courses available for people to take, for example law-AI joint degrees could be created.

The report also discusses the social issues surrounding integrating AI into society. The mission has identified issues, such as staff feeling alienated by the technology they may need to work with, and give potential solutions to these problems which may arise should an 'AI take-off' occur. One potential solution offered is a formal education and lifelong learning overhaul to equip people with the creative skills that are becoming more vital. It is important to recognise issues such as this to keep society running smoothly in a technological transition.

For our purposes, Chapter 5 is particularly relevant, it is entitled 'What are the Ethics of AI?' The mission has started to build an ethical framework for the development of AI. They lay out five principles:

- **Greater transparency** The document recognises that explaining the decisions made by machine learning algorithms, particularly deep neural networks, is difficult because of the way the algorithms work. It also raises questions as to whether algorithms whose decisions cannot be explained should be used in situations as crucial to the life of an individual as access to credit, employments, accommodations, justice and health. They also make the point that accountability of technology is one of the conditions for its social acceptability and that if the technology is not socially accepted, many of the benefits it could bring to
society could be lost.

- **Incorporating ethics into the training of engineers and researchers studying AI** 
The mission recognises that technical people are not getting enough training in ethical issues which are likely to become only more prevalent in technical areas in the future. The article says that these people do have a certain amount of responsibility with regards to the affects of the artificial intelligence they create, but recognises that they not necessarily equip to consider these issues fully.

- **Protection of rights and freedoms** The article recognises that current legislation on data protection generally only deals with personal data and that many issues raised by the use of algorithms now constitute a 'blind spot' of the law. In the context of deep learning, data is used on a massive scale to produce correlations which could affect whole groups of individuals. The legislation doesn't account for how data is used in these deep learning algorithms.

- **Staying in control of AI** This section makes the important point that artificial intelligence systems are capable of making mistakes, and depending on where the technology is being used, this could have disastrous consequences. They discuss situations where is would and wouldn't be appropriate to use AI algorithms based on this fallibility.

- **Specific Governance of Ethics in AI** This section talks about the requirement to set up advisory committees and set up international debate on ethics for digital technology and artificial intelligence, recognising that the role of ethics in these areas has become so significant in recent years.
