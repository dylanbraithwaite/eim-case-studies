# Credit Scoring

Society has many existing ways of determining and recording how trustworthy someone is. A clear example of this is the notion of a criminal record. When a person breaks the law, this is (usually) noted on their criminal record, which is somewhat accessible to others to view. This can be used by others to assess if someone is (un)suitable for certain jobs or roles in society. Another example is a financial credit report and associated credit score. This is a collection of all the (good, and bad) "credit-relevant" actions a person has undertaken over the past 5-10 years, and a "score" calculated from these. Pay your bills on time: your credit score goes up. Default on a loan: your credit score goes down. Though a criminal record and a credit report are both statements of fact, a credit score is something that is calculated/inferred from a credit report, and thus is a slightly more abstract and ill-defined concept. Though, as it is entirely based on actions that are widely perceive to be credit-relevant, it is a reaonable proxy for credit worthiness. And it is often implemented as such a measure: a future loan application, credit card application, or mobile phone contract, will be approved or rejected on the basis of such a score.

On a very informal, but still important, level, people have a networks of trust that allow them to assess how trustowrthy someone else is. Letters of reference, public image, media report, and even gossip, all contribute to how much, or little, we trust certain individuals. This is a very difficult thing to quantify, and no-one has ever tried to assign a "score" to this; that is, until now.

Let's go back to credit scores for a moment. Credit reporting companies have access to vast quantites of credit-relevant data about people, and use these to compute credit scores. They generally don't consider information such as what car you drive, or where you buy your groceries. But now there are new, "alternate" credit-reporting companies appearing, who claim that, through the power of mathematics, they can take **all** data about you and turn it into an "alternate" credit score. As the founder of one such company said: "All data is credit data". By hoovering up your entire online presence (for example: all the data from all the social media platforms you are registered on), they claim that they can compute a (financial) credit score for you. This includes factoring in which bars you visit, who your friends are, and how much time you spend in bookshops. When they say all data, they're not kidding. But to process such vast quantities of data, they employ mathematicians to process it and make judgements on how to turn it all in to one number.

So can we extend this to the "vague" notion of social trust? Well, the Chinese government seem to think so. They're currently developing a "social credit scoring system", which **literally** takes in all data about you. Wear nice clothers: your score goes up. Participate in a community activity: your score goes up. Got a parking fine: your score goes down. Write something unpleasant on social media: your score goes down. And, just as this takes in all parts of your life to compute a score, it is used in all parts of your life to judge your trustworthiness. 
But who would have the technical understanding and means to convert this ocean of data about someone into a single integer? Mathematicians, of course.
