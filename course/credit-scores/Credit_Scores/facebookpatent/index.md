#Facebook Patent

In 2012, Facebook filed a patent entitled 'Authorization and Authentication Based on an Individual's Social Network', which was then issued in 2015. 

The primary purpose of the invention described in the patent is to allow an individual to access content through a social network identification. The patent says:

>*"The invention provides a method of authorizing transmission of content to an individual as a way to filter out unwanted communication such as SPAM or content that the individual might find to be offensive, and a method of authenticating individuals for access to content or service that makes the content or service available to more users while limiting access to potentially abusive users of the content or service."*

This is describing **Facebook-Connect**, a single sign-on application that allows users to interact on other websites through their Facebook account. 

The [part involving credit rating](/course/course/credit-scores/Credit_Scores/facebookpatent/quote) is only a small section in the patent application. Basically, there are three main steps:

A credit score based soley on your social media network is highly questionable. Can the people who you're friends with on Facebook accurately determine how creditworthy you are? Should we be concerned about the invasion to our privacy that such an invention will cause? 

Packin and Lev-Aretz (2016) emphasises that, unlike other big data applications that collect and anonymise information, "the use of social intelligence for financial ranking is dependent upon personal identification";  the user's entire activity is scanned, including "not only visible online footprints but also private exchanges".

Further, the patent claims that *"a black list that is maintained for B is requested and received from the social network database‚Äù*. This means that a bank may be requested to upload the credit ratings of its customers onto Facebook servers. This list will then be maintained by Facebook so the bank will never be allowed to own the results - it will always depend on Facebook to visualise the results.

Recently, it has been released that Facebook has tried to partner up with banks. Click [here](/course/course/credit-scores/Credit_Scores/facebookpatent/banks) for more information.
