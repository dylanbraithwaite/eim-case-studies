>*"FIG. 9 is a flow diagram that illustrates the steps carried out in authenticating B for access to a loan. In Step 910, the lender receives a request for a loan from B. The request includes certain identifying information of B, such as B’s e-mail address. In Step 920, in accordance with the methods described in the application, “Method of Sharing Social Network Information with Existing User Databases,” (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/854,610, issued as U.S. Pat. No. 8,478,078), filed Jun. 14, 2004, this lender makes a request to a social network database for a graph representation of B’s social network and receives the graph representation of B’s social network. In Step 930, a black list that is maintained for B is requested and received from the social network database in the same manner as in Step 920. In Step 940, a gray list is derived from the black list and B’s social network In Step 950, a breadth first search (or alternatively, a depth first search) is conducted on B’s social network to generate a white list. All members of B’s social network who are connected to B along a path that does not traverse through any unauthorized nodes (i.e., individuals identified in the gray list) get included on this white list. Optionally, the lender may specify a maximum degree of separation value (e.g., N.sub.max). If it is specified, the white list will include only those members of B’s social network who are within N.sub.max degrees of separation from B. In Step 960, the credit ratings of individuals in the white list are retrieved and weighting factors are applied to the credit ratings based on the degree of separation between the individual and B. As an example, a weighting factor of 1/10.sup.N may be applied to the credit ratings, where N is the degree of separation between the individual and B. If the average credit rating is above a minimum score, B is authenticated and the processing of B’s loan application is permitted to proceed (Steps 970 and 980). If not, B is not authenticated, and B’s loan application is rejected (Steps 970 and 990)."*
