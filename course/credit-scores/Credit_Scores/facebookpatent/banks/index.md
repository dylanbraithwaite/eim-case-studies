#Facebook Partnership with Banks

On August 6th 2018, The Wall Street Journal published an article claiming that over the past year Facebook has asked JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co., Citigroup Inc. and U.S. Bancorp to discuss "potential offerings it could host for bank customers on Facebook Messenger". 
To give but one example, Facebook has suggested it could implement a feature on Messenger that would allow uses to check their current account balances. 

As part of the deals, Facebook has asked banks for information about "where their users are shopping with their debit and credit cards outside purchases they make using Facebook Messenger". 
These partnerships constitute an attempt to increase user engagement by transforming Messenger "into a hub for customer serivce and commerce". 

They have already partnered with PayPal Holdings Inc. which allows users to send money through Messenger.

**Why would Facebook want this?**

This would allow Facebook to collect data on how users spend their money. 
According to Mauldin in a *TechCrunch* article entitled 'The Bank of Facebook', this could be paired up with data collected using their [patented invention](/course/course/credit-scores/Credit_Scores/facebookpatent) (discussed elsewhere on the site) and applied to targeted advertising or even credit scoring.
