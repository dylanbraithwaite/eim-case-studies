#Types of Data

Credit Scores can be based on different types of data: baseline credit data or alternative credit data [5].

##Baseline Credit Data

This is data that is typically reported to the national credit bureaus. It includes:
	* Identifying information: *an individual's name, birth date, current and previous addresses and social security number.*
	* Credit account data: *types of accounts (credit cards, auto loans, student loans, mortgages, etc.), dates the accounts were opened, credit limits or loan ammounts, account balances, and payment histories.*
	* Payment-related public record data: *bankruptcies, foreclosures, tax liens, wage attachements and civil judgements.*
	* Histories of collections activities: *amounts currently owed, names of the original creditors.*

##Alternative Credit Data

Unlike baseline credit data, this is not typically fully reported to the national credit bureaus.
There are two types: 
	* mainstream alternative credit data, which is data similar in kind to baseline credit data, such as monthly bill payments. 
	* fringe alternative credit data, which is not similar in kind to baseline credit data, such as criminal convictions or number of friends on a social networking site.

##Traditional Models

Traditional models, such as the standard FICO score, use baseline credit data. The FICO score is calculated using 5 main categories of data: payment history (35%), amounts owed (30%), length of credit history (15%), new credit (10%) and credit mix (10%) [1].

##Mainstream Alternative Models

These models consider mainstream alternative credit data. An example of such model is VantageScore. Developers claim it is more inclusive than the FICO score as it uses a "broader and deeper set of credit file data" [5]. It takes into consideration (in descending order of importance):
	- payment history - including certain bill payment data, if available;
	- age and type of credit;
	- percent of credit limit used;
	- total balances/debt;
	- available credit;
	- recent credit behaviour and inquiries.

##Fringe Alternative Models

These models consider fringe credit data.

##Problem with Traditional Models

Traditional credit scoring only consider a relatively limited set of data points, they may not accurately predict the creditworthiness of many *thin-file* consumers. Thin-file consumers are people who have a limited credit history, for example a consumer who has had few or no loans or credit cards.

In 'Big Data, a Big Disappointment for Scoring Consumer Creditworthiness', Yu, McLaughlin and Levy state that 

>*"Problems exist with the traditional credit scoring system. First, credit scores cannot predict if any particular person will actually engage in the behavior. In fact, often the probability is greater that a particular low-scoring person will not engage in the behavior. Second, many low-income consumers have low credit scores simply because they have either a "thin file” or "no file”... A denial of credit to these consumers is based on the absence of credit history rather than anything negative in their credit histories.*

In order to overcome these problems there are currently a number of companies that are developing fringe alternative models. The following list is taken from 'On Social Credit and the Right to be Unnetworked' by Packin and Lev-Aretz:
	- **Lenddo:** To apply for a loan, users authorise Lenddo to access their social media profiles, from which Lenddo's model calculates a score that determines whtehr the applicant can receive a loan and the terms under which such a loan will be granted. Rather than actually lending money, Lenddo has started selling its algorithmic services to businesses inside and outside the financial sector.

	- **ZestFinance:** Created by the ex-CIO of Google, Douglas Merrill, ZestFinance have created ZAML Platform, which uses machine learning to analyse thousands of non-traditional and traditional variables to score borrowers.

	- **LendUp:** Mixes data from credit bureaus with reputation information taken from the user's social networks. Unlike Lendoo, it is not mandatory for the user to connect their social network, although they are encouraged to fully disclose their social information because "the more they reveal, the better their chances of approval", as highlighted by Armour in the article 'Borrowers Hit Social-Media Hurdles' in the Wall Street Journal.
	- **Neo and Earnest:** These are U.S based lenders that calculate a score based on both the borrower's annual income and social network data. 
	- **Kreditech:** A German startup that screens microloan applicants based on social and commerce data. 
	- **InVenture:** This Silicon Valley-based company and determines whether a person is creditworthy based on data taken from their smartphones, for example the content of their text messages, emails, Facebook or Twitter updates and the frequency of calls. 
	- **Lighter Capital:** This is an online revenue lender for technology companies and gleans information from social media data, including a business' LinkedIn pade and consumer feedback. 
	- **Kabbage:** This small business creditor takes into account real-time information from bank accounts, social networks, and web analytical services into their analysis of whether or not to authorise the loan. 
	- **Hello Soda:** Their product, PROFILE, lets lenders determine the creditworthiness of people by identifying their personality attributes from language used in their social media. 
	

Facebook has also recently filed a patent that could be applied to credit scoring. In order to learn more about this, click [here](http://db716.user.srcf.net/eim/course/credit-scores/Credit_Scores/facebookpatent).
