#Lenddo Patent

This page aims to summarise the details of the Lenddo patent. 

An individual who wants to borrow funds must register with the system. This entails creating a user profile by entering personal data into the system through the website or user interface. 

After the user has applied for a loan, the system searches their social graph (a graph created by drawing an edge between the user and the people, places, and things they interact with online) to extract user data from their online social footprint. Below is an example of a social graph [2].

User data is then blended with the data gathered from the online social footprint and other data required by the specified predictive model. 

The next action is to either fulfill the loan request by supplying the requested funds to the user or requiring the user to take actions to improve his score to qualify for the funds, which include:

	- Completing interactive training content about financial responsibility;
	
	- Providing more personal data and increased access to the user's social graph;
	
	- Securing more endorsements from friends and affiliates in a network;
	
	- Resolving outstanding perceived negative conditions that hurt his credit score.

The invention also supports the collection treatment of the loan if the borrower can't make timely payments towards the repayment of the loan, or failing to meet the agreed terms and condtitions. This collection treatement can include publishing news of a user's loan default or delinquency to various social networks as well as the user's network. Furthermore, a treatment action can also reflecting negative associations, such as affiliations with *troubled* borrowers or users, on individual's online social footprint. This could encourage the use of "peer pressure" to get a delinquent user to make their payments on time, effectively "providing an informal joint guarantee on the user's loan."

**How is the user dashboard created?**

When creating a profile, the user must input personal information, including name, address, date of birth, employment history, the level of education completed, income level, assets, debts, demographic information, character references, affiliates, associations and any other uniquely identifying items of informations such as Tax Indentification Number (TIN), Social Security System (SSS) number or Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) number. Furthermore, they could be asked to input other information such as occupation, near and long-term goals, monthly earnings, and amount of outstanding debt.

The user's profile also requires the user to "list the social networks in the social graph which the user participates or is a member, which can include but are not limited to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, MSN, Yahoo!, Gmail, Google Plus+, MySpace, and MeetUp". As part of indicating these social networks, the user must give the system access to them **by providing login information**. In the patent it is stated that "information gathered from the social networks in which the user participates can also be used to assess the character and credibility of the user as part of determining how much of a credit risk the user might be."

When applying for the loan, the user inputs the loan information that indicates the type or purpose and amount of loan desired. Also, the loan application can request the user to indicate the intended usage of the loan indicated by percent allocation. Then, "if the information provided by the user in the loan application is inconsistent with the information that the system finds in the user's social footprint, the approval of the loan may be in jeopardy." 

**What does this mean?** Say you apply for a loan, say of the amount £150 for the purpose of textbooks for a class you are taking. However, the system finds in your social footprint no mention of you taing a class in any communications, comments, posts or personal information. Rather, it finds in a recent communication that you want to go with your friends to a upcoming music festival selling tickets as £150. This would call into question your credibility the the probability of your loan being approved would be negatively impacted. 

It is highlighted that insights obtained from available personal data and data gathered online can aid pattern recognition between those who repay debt and those who don't. *"Good sources for pattern recognition include word combinations in text indicating deceptive use of loan funds, or in contrast, corroborating text that affirms the intended use of the funds".*

Other sources of 'insight' about people's behaviour towards loans to determine credit worthiness used are:

	- geospacial data, including location, places of frequent activity etc. *"An individual who is frequently spending time in a location common to other individuals who do repay loans provides such insightful geospacial data.*
	
  - Visual evidence, either by photograph or video.
  
	- Biometric information, such as typing habits, verbal audio content, and body images including photos
	
	- Aspects of the computing device, such as time setting, browser type, browser history, borwser settings
	
	- Other characteristics, including friendship, affiliatiates, attitude, habits, purchasing trends, travel patterns, long term goals, extracurricular involvement and stability of an individual (i.e. the duration of time in which the person has lived in the same place).

This mass surveillance of an individual borders on **spying**. 

Due to the lack of baseline credit data, this fringe alternative data is collected and used as proxies for everything in order to determine creditworthiness. But, should they be relied? Are they appropriate to apply to this problem? Can they accurately determine how creditworthy an individual is? Not only this, but some of this data could be used as proxies for characteristics such as race or gender, which could lead to discrimination of certain groups of people.
