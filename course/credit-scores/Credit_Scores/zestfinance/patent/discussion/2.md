#Gathering and Tranforming Data

[Insert video of people discussing issue]

*Include information below*

For these alternative credit scoring models, big data is needed. In 'Big Data, a Big Disappointment for Scoring Consumer Creditworthiness', Yu, McLaughlin and Levy describe the methods used to collect data.
	1. **Cookie:** a cookie can contain various types of information, including but not limited to, the time of visit, the subpages visited, the items purchased (if the data is being collected from an online retail website such as Amazon). Cookies can also designate a unique ID to someone's computer, which allows third party tracking companies to see other pages visited. 
	2. **Web Beacon:** this can not only track which webpages a person visits, but also records the text typed in. 
	3. **Web Crawling:** this involves the duplication and categorization of information from websites; programmers can write software that scans websites and sorts posts. 
 
 In relation to ZestFinance's credit scoring model, they collect the following data:
 	- the borrower's data: *information provided directly by the applicant during the application process, as well as other information such as web-browser activity, taken from the applicant's device at the time they applies for a loan online (e.g. how long the applicant spends reviewing the terms and conditions page to determine whether they read it carefully - used as a proxy for responsibility)*;
 	- proprietary data: *information obtained from privately or governmentally owned data stores and may encompass everything from an someone's online and offline purchase history to health and medical data*;
 	- public data: *information that ZestFinance obtains from automated searches of the Internet and techniques such as web crawling and scraping*;
 	- social network data: *information obtained from the borrower's social media posts and "any social graph information for any or all members of the borrower's social network"*.
 
This raw input data is not all necessarily objective, and may reflect forms of preexisting bias and discrimination. This is because not all data is created or collected equally. For example, there may be mechanisms that collect data that favours particular groups and excludes others. If the credit scores rely on non-neutral data collection methods, then the data may fail to give a representative sample of all groups and lead some groups being treated less favourably or ignored by the scorer's model. 
 
Another problem faced is accuracy. Whilst big data does address flaws in the current credit scoring system, there are definite drawbacks to expanding credit variables from 15 to thousands 30. Instead of minimising the impact of unimportant credit signal, a big data approach could amplify the significance of a completely irrelevant signal. 
 
 Nassim Taleb, a risk engineering professor at New York Univeristy, explains:
 
>*"…if I generate…a set of 200 variables — completely random and totally unrelated to each other—with about 1,000 data points for each, then it would be near impossible not to find in it a certain number of ‘significant’ correlations of sorts.”*

Finally, data collection and transformation could lead to an issue of transparancy. Most, if not all, credit scoring companies treat their data sources as proprietary trade secrets. This means that, in practice, some consumers have no real means to understand what could potentially affect their credit ratings, and even less ability to challenge their scores, or test whether it is accurate. 

>*"Assuming that a diligent applicant could first identify an error among the thousands of entries in the credit scorer's raw data set, it is unlikely that the applicant would have the capacity to prove that the error resulted in a faulty score."* - Hurley and Adebayo (2017)

Furthermore, due to the extensive transformation process, which involves many aggregations and combinations of data points, as well as subjective decisions made by the data scientist, it is unlikely that a consumer could actually challenge their credit score.
