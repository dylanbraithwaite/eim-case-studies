#Defining the Problem and Specifying the Target Variable

[Insert video of people discussing issue]

*Include information below*

In order to use machine-learning techniques to solve a problem or make predictions, the data scientist must define the problem and decide exactly what they want to predict. In the case of an unstructured problem like predicting creditworthiness, where there's no single correct answer, "articulating a proper and quantifiable definition is critical" according to Adebayo and Hurley (2017). One way in which this can be done is by choosing a state or outcome of interest, referred to as a 'target variable'. Hurley and Adebayo highlight that:

>*A poorly-crafted definition could also lead to inadvertent discrimination, where "data miners [] unintentionally parse the problem and define target variables in such a way that protected classes happen to be subject to systematically less favorable determinations."*

Furthermore, when target variables are defined subjectively, there is a "grey area" in which human judgment may have resulted in bias, and there is no guarantee that the machine-learning process will necessarily correct this.

ZestFinance's patent application does not give a definition of 'creditworthiness' or describe the target variable it uses and so it is unclear how they do this. 

Hurley and Adebayo also state that "there is also no reason to assume that these companies have the borrowers' interests at heart." 

>*"A recent study of online payday lending notes that the "lenders [using] sophisticated technology and advanced algorithms to predict which applicants are most likely to repay loans ... continue to charge interest rates usually in excess of 300 percent APR...""*

This may hint at the fact that alternative credit scorers, like ZestFinance, may not be truly interested in predicting consumer creditworthiness, but instead in finding vulnerable, high-value targets for payday loans (a relatively small amount of money lent at a high rate of interest on the agreement that it will be repaid when the borrower receives their next wages). Furthermore, the majority of payday borrowers come from poor and minority communities, according to Upturn (2015). Therefore, rather than expanding access to underserved groups, these alternative credit scores may actually disservice historically disadvantaged groups.
