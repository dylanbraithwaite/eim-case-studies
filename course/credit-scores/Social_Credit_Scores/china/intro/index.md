#Introduction

China is building a Social Credit System (SCS) to measure and rate the trust of its citizens. It's SCS was laid out in a plan which was released in 2014.
It extends the economic concept of *creditworthiness* beyond the ability and willingnes to repay loans. 
The aim of the Chinese Government is to establish a "system of laws and standards to support the integration of credit information and the system of rewards and punishments" by 2020.

A social credit score can be defined as a rating for the consumer calculated by their "position in a social structure based on esteem that is bestowed by others."

The key focus of the Chinese social credit score will be a person's trustworthiness as well as their "guanxi" (social relation), and hence measure a person's overall *goodness*.

Above we mentioned a plan released in 2014 by the Chinese Government that laid out goals to be met by 2020 in order to build the SCS. In the [next section](https://cueimps.soc.srcf.net/course/course/credit-scores/Social_Credit_Scores/china/plan), we discover the details of this plan.
