#Data Collection

The plan asks for the *"interconnection and interactivity of... credit information systems and... networks that cover all information subjects, all credit information categories, and all regions nationwide"*

Most of the document is an exhaustive list of areas in which "credit" or "sincerity" (which that plan says is the basis of the SCS) information must be gathered and included in the SCS, such as:
  - E-commerce;
	- Culture, Sports and Tourism;
	- Traffic and Transportation;
	- Finance;
	- Health, etc. 

The database will consist of data on both individuals and legal entities like non-governmental organizations and businesses. The SCS aims to make this data public. 

Considering how fast data is being digitised in China, there is big potential for data collection by real-time monitoring:

"E-commerce platforms could provide the Social Credit System with data on companiesâ€™ reliability during online business activities, for example, with regard to payments, delivery, product quality, and customer satisfaction. Particularly for companies active in the automobile, transportation, and logistics industries, real-time monitoring of cars via traffc systems and on-board units will provide the basis for their future social credit ratings." (Meissner)
