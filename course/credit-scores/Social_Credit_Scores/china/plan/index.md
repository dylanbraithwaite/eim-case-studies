#2014 Social Credit Plan

The Plan reveals that the SCS has two main components:
  1. A dataset integrating currently disconnected data held by government and non-governmental entities across China and expanding data collection efforts.
  2. System of "carrots and sticks" in which those who have transgressed (e.g. failed to comply with a court judgement) face penalties that stay on their records and in turn block them from receiving various services, such as booking airplane tickets, and those who have a positive evaluation can reap the benefits of being on the *right side of the system*.

- [Generation of Social Credit Scores](https://cueimps.soc.srcf.net/course/course/credit-scores/Social_Credit_Scores/china/plan/scoring)
  
Over 30 local governmets have already started [piloting social credit systems](https://cueimps.soc.srcf.net/course/course/credit-scores/Social_Credit_Scores/china/plan/pilots), although they use different approaches to calculate the scores. Furthermore, large Internet companies have also been given licenses to run their own pilots, the most widely used being Alibaba's [Seasame Credit](https://cueimps.soc.srcf.net/course/course/credit-scores/Social_Credit_Scores/china/plan/scoring/3/sesamecredit).
