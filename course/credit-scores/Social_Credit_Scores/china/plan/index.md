#2014 Social Credit Plan

The Plan reveals that the SCS has two main components:
  1. A dataset integrating currently disconnected data held by government and non-governmental entities across China and expanding data collection efforts.
  2. System of "carrots and sticks" in which those who have transgressed (e.g. failed to comply with a court judgement) face penalties that stay on their records and in turn block them from receiving various services, such as booking airplane tickets, and those who have a positive evaluation can reap the benefits of being on the *right side of the system*.
