#The National Enterprise Credit Information Publicity System and the Credit China Platform

Both of these are government credit information platforms that currently provide information on blacklisted companies (for example lists of thousands of companies not allowed to issue bonds or incest in publicly traded companies) as well as an overview of positive and negative credit records of companies.
