#Generation of Social Credit Scores

Although there are many details on how the data will be collected and shared under the Social Credit System, there is little information on how this data will be used and evalutated - the exact algorithms and criteria generating the different credit ratings is still unknown. 
	
As it stands, the Social Credit System will not generate one score for every company. The plan of the Chinese Government is to have a "diversified and decentralized market for social credit ratings", which will include central government credit records, sectoral social credit ratings, commercial credit rating servies and the People's Bank of China's credit rating center. However, it is not yet certain exactly what the system will look like.
