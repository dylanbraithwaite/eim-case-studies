#Commercial Credit Rating Services

These will be a large part of the SCS. The current idea is that the Chinese Govenment will share its own data with these commercial services and receive their data on a company's trutworthiness in return. 

There are already many companies that are creating their own rating servies, including:
- Alibaba (e-commerce company) - market cap of US\$499.4 Billion as of June 2018;
- JD (e-commerce company) - market cap of US\$44.5 Billion as of June 2018;
- Baidu (search platform) - market cap of US\$94.1 Billion as of June 2018;
- Wanda (commercial property company and cinema chain operator)  - market cap of \$29.9 Billion as of May 2016;
- China Telecom (state-owned telecommunication company)  - market cap of \$38.6 Billion as of June 2018;
- Fosum (investment company)  - market cap of US\$18.6 Billion as of June 2018.

Looking at the market cap of each of these, they are extremely large companies and have a lot of influence in China. 

>*"As of March 2017, 137 commercial credit reporting companies were active on the Chinese market, most based in Beijing or Shanghai."* (Meissner)

This may result in some regional bias - someone in Beijing or Shanghai don't necessarily understand the values of a rural farmer. 

According to Meissner, some companies have even reportedly signed contracts for sharing credit information with the stateâ€™s data platform. 

Sesame Credit is the credit rating system developed by Alibaba. Click [here](https://cueimps.soc.srcf.net/course/course/credit-scores/Social_Credit_Scores/china/plan/scoring/3/sesamecredit) to find out more about it.
