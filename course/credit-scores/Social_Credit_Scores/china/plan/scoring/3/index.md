#Commercial Credit Rating Services

These will be a large part of the SCS. The current idea is that the Chinese Govenment will share its own data with these commercial services and receive their data on a company's trutworthiness in return. 

There are already many companies that are creating their own rating servies, including:
- Alibaba (e-commerce company);
- JD (e-commerce company);
- Baidu (search platform);
- Wanda (commercial property company and cinema chain operator);
- China Telecom (state-owned telecommunication company);
- Fosum (investment company).

>*"As of March 2017, 137 commercial credit reporting companies were active on the Chinese market, most based in Beijing or Shanghai."* (Meissner)

According to Meissner, some companies have even reportedly signed contracts for sharing credit information with the stateâ€™s data platform. 

Sesame Credit is the credit rating system developed by Alibaba. Click [here](https://cueimps.soc.srcf.net/course/course/credit-scores/Social_Credit_Scores/china/plan/scoring/3/sesamecredit) to find out more about it.
