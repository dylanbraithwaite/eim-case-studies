#Honest Shanghai

Honest Shanghai is one of three-dozen social credit systems run by local governments throughout China; they're part of the Chinese Government's goal to create the SCS. 

The rating, however, is not done by the government. It is done by a third party - the software company Zhengxin Fangsheng. 

>*"A representative named Wu said his company wouldn't have worked on the Honest Shanghai app unless the government asked it to, so yes, Wu said, the government has every intention to rate its residents' public credit."*  - Schmitz in `What's Your `Public Credit Score'? The Shanghai Government Can Tell You'
