#Pilot in Rongcheng

The system devised in Rongcheng assigns 1,000 points at the beginning to each of the 740,000 adult residents. A citizen can then either win or lose points depending on the actions they take.

For example, if the person gets a traffic ticket, they lose 5 points; conversely, they can earn credit by donating to charity or by volunteering in the city's program. 

According to government officials, this is one of the most successful pilots so far, largely due to the fact that the community has embraced it. 

Residents hold a grade from A+++ to D depending on their score bracket. People with a triple-A score are rewarded with perks, such as receiving a \$50 heating discount every winter and obtaining better terms on bank loans. 


The paragraphs above highlight the possibility of **buying** credit. Those who can afford to donate to a charity, will obtain more credit. Those who have a highly ranked job and can afford to take a day off, can volunteer and gain more credit. This favours middle-to-upper class citizens and may result in a selection of the population *spiralling up*, whereas others who are not in this section of society may *spiral down* and be *trapped*. Not only this, but having more credit may have a monetary reward (for example obtaining a \$50 heating discount), meaning it may be possible to 'buy' credit for a certain amount of money and then receiving more money than initially 'invested' as a  *reward*. 

However, according to Mistream (2018), although the scoring system extends to every part of someone's life, **many of the city's residents don't even know it exists**, until they want to, for example, buy a house or apply for an academic title.
This is quite scary: the government in collecting a massive amount of information about each individual, calculating a score to determine how *trustworthy* the person is, and many aren't even aware that this is even happening, nor do they get the choice to *opt-out*. They only find out they're being judged until it's too late.
