Examples of pilots that starting in April 2016 (Ohlberg 2017):

  - **Zhengzhou (Henan)**: Refusing to comply with a court order to pay debt results in dial tone of the person's phone to be changed to a 'shaming' announcement;
  
  - **Wuhan (Hubei)**: Files for students over 18 recording misbehaviour like cheating on exams, plagiarism, and unpaid tuition fees.
  
  - **Luzhou (Sichuan)**: SCS for the liquor industry: Baiju-producing companies are monitored for compliance with regulations.
  
  - **Rongcheng (Shandong)**: Individual scores and grades for residents. Misbehaviour (littering, jaywalking) results in score deduction and punishement; exemplary behaviour (caring for aged parents) results in good ratings and benefits.
