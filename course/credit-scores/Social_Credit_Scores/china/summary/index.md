#Summary of Social Credit System

**Goal:** Use creditworthiness to strengthen trust and order in government, throughout life in China.

**Type:** Public

**Operated by:** National Development and Reform Commission as lead, other government departments for areas of jurisdiction

**Legal status:** Official government plan and policy, expanded by local and sectoral regulations. 

**Who is rated/scored?** No individual choice, data is autimatically collected and strict user constent, processig and sharing provisions may be imposed.

**Data sources:** Government data from departments at all levels, trains, courts, etc., some private firms

**Output:** Laws, databases, systems for data exchange, punishments and incentives. Scores are possible in the future.

**Consequences of low or bad credit:** Expanding "rewards" and "punishments", including lost access to government subsidies, inability to purchase plane/train tickets. 

The Chinese Social Credit System shows a vision of a digital future where we're all locked in a system of constant monitoring, accounting, categorising and tracking. 
This has the potential to have disastrous consequences for those who *"challenge the hegemony in any way... or even just for those who do not have the resources or capacity to participate in the socioeconomic system on the terms mandated"* (Brehm and Loubere 2018).
