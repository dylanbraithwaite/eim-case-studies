#Consequences

The Social Credit system could prevent illegal behaviour, improve the trustworthiness of companies, and help build a new culture of socially and environmentally responsible behaviour. Also, making information about companies and their social credit records accessible for everyone on centralised online platforms will help increase transparency and could aid businesses make better judgements on potential new partners. Furthermore, the Social Credit System could create new markets for advanced IT-technologies, including traffic monitoring and image recognition.

However, there are many areas of concern. Firstly, the SCS may have a negative implication on freedom of speech, for ecample, if a critical comment about the government, does this lower someone's social credit score?
Once the SCS has been implemented, the government will have an incredibly large amount of data at its disposal to control and intervene in society, politics and the economy. This data could be misued, and as a result we must ask: shouls one entity have acess to so much data about millions of people and businesses, which can potentially be used against them?

Another concern is that people may be *trapped* in "China's social credit web" (Mistream 2018). The unified social credit system will really all sectors of society against those that are deemed to be 'untrustworthy'. Zhang Lifan, a sociologist, says that 
>*"The Chinese government is increasingly inclined to use high tech to monitor ordinary people, turning China into a police state, a big prison‚Äù* (Mistream 2018)

Furthermore, the SCS poses a constant risk to the protection of data. Not only will a major data leak expose personal data on Chinese citizens, it could also result in severe economic damage due to the sharing or selling of sensitive company data to competitors (Meissner). 

Finally, these social credit ratings may be a subtle tool for discrimination. International companies can easily be subject to "systematic and intential bias in facor of Chinese enterprises", as stated by Meissner in 'China's Social Credit System: A big-data enabled approach to market regulation with broad implications for doing business in China'.
