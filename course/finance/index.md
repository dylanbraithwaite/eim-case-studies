# Financial Mathematics and the Economy

In recent years, mathematics has come to play a central role in finance. Far from simply *adding up the numbers*, mathematicians and their work are deeply involved in the production and trading of complex financial products. However, this is not without its drawbacks. By allowing individuals to trade more products, at greater (automated) speed, and of greater complexity, mathematicians have now found themselves as part of the cause of several financial catastrophes, each worse than the last.


The [Libor scandal](/course/course/finance/libor) is an egregious example of mathematicians working in finance who were consumed by greed and used their position to intentionally rig the financial market in their favour.

The over-use and mis-use of [Collateralised debt obligations](/course/course/finance/cdos) (CDOs), a mathematicial construct which re-packaged interest-bearing debts in such as way as to "increase their value" led to the worst financial crashe in living memory; the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, the effects of which we still feel today.

The [Black-Scholes equation](/course/course/finance/Black-Scholes) for options pricing was hailed as a spectacular interdisciplinary achievement in mathematics and economics, which for the first time enabled the market to use uniform method for pricing options that always worked. Except when it didn't. 



OLD SUMMARY=======

In 2008 the economic crash swept across the globe, collapsing the housing market, the credit market, banks, businessess and homes. The effects are still being felt to this day, a decade later. The United Kingdom, for example, entered an enormous time of recession that saw its bank rate enter 10 years of being almost 0, which has only started to recover in mid-2018. The United States has begun QE$\infty$, an endless printing of new money to give to banks and businesses to try and stimulate the economy. Most countries in the EU are only now starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel after years of hardship and austerity.

The topics here cover events that caused and followed the Global Financial Crash and the hand that mathematicians played in causing it.
