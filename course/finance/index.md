# Finance and the Economic Crash

In 2008 the economic crash swept across the globe, collapsing the housing market, the credit market, banks, businessess and homes. The effects are still being felt to this day, a decade later. The United Kingdom, for example, entered an enormous time of recession that saw its bank rate enter 10 years of being almost 0, which has only started to recover in mid-2018. The United States has begun QE$\infty$, an endless printing of new money to give to banks and businesses to try and stimulate the economy. Most countries in the EU are only now starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel after years of hardship and austerity.

The topics here cover events that caused and followed the Global Financial Crash and the hand that mathematicians played in causing it.
