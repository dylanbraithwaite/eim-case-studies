#Glossary

  - **Subprime Mortgage:** A subprime mortgage is a type of loan given to people with a poor credit score and who therefore do not qualify for conventional mortgages. As subprime borrowers are higher risk, the subprime mortgages charge a greater interest rate.
  
  - **Credit Default Swap:** A Credit Default Swap (CDS) is a financial swap agreement that says that the seller will compensate the buyer in the event of a debt default or other credit event. In other words, the seller of the CDS insures the buyer against the asset defaulting. 
  - **Tranche:** A portion of something, especially money.
  - **Write-down:** A reduction in the estimated or nominal value of an asset.
  - **Arbitrage:** The simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset to profit from an imbalance in the price. It is a trade that profits by exploiting the price differences of identical or similar financial instruments on different markets or in different forms.
  - **Mark-to-Market:** A measure of the fair value of accounts that can change over time, such as assets and liabilities.
  - **Short:** Short selling is the sale of a security that is not owned by the seller or that the seller has borrowed. Short selling is motivated by the belief that a security's price will decline, enabling it to be bought back at a lower price to make a profit.
  - **Default:** the failure to pay interest or principal on a loan or security when due.
  - **Adjustable-rate Mortgages and their Honeymoon Period:** An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a type of mortgage in which the interest rate varies throughout the lifetime of the loan. The 'honeymoon period' of such a loan is the first few years when the initial monthly payments will have a much smaller interest rate than that of a standard 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. However, after that honeymoon period, ARMs adjust according to a predetermined index [1].
