# The Black-Scholes Equation

In 1973, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes derived an equation for option pricing; the equation describes how the price of an option should evolve as a function of time and the current market price of the stock. It also takes into account the 'risk-free interest rate' and the 'volatility' of the stock.

Black and Scholes were by no means the first to apply mathematics to the stock market -- that claim lies with Louis Bachelier, a french mathematician who in 1900 wrote his PhD thesis, *Théorie de la spéculation*, on the behaviour of stock prices and how to price derivative contracts.
