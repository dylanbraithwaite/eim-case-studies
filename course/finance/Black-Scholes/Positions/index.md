 - *Short (or short position):* A short, or short position, is selling first and then buying later. The trader's expectation is that the price will drop; the price they sell at is higher than the price they hope to buy it at later. In the foreign exchange and futures markets, a short position can be initiated at any time. The difference between the sale price and the buy price produces a profit or loss. In the stock market, a trader must borrow shares from a broker in order to short them. This creates a share deficient in the account. When the trader buys the shares back, the borrowed shares are returned to the broker and the profit or loss on the trade is realised.

 - *Long (or long position):* A long is the buying of a security such as a stock, commodity, or currency with the expectation that the asset will rise in value. In the context of options, long is the buying of an options contract. An investor that expects an asset's price to fall will go long on a put option, and an investor that hopes to benefit from an upward price movement will be long a call option.
