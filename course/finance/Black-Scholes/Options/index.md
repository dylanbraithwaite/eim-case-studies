 - <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp" target="_blank">*Option:*</a> A type of financial derivative sold by an option writer to an option buyer. It is a contract offering the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (if it is a *call* option) or to sell (if it is a *put* option) a particular underlying asset (or 'stock') at an agreed-upon price, during a certain period of time, or on a specific date. The agreed upon price is called the *strike price*. If the buyer chooses to utilise their right to buy or to sell the underlying asset, we say the option is *exercised*.

 - <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/americanoption.asp" target="_blank">*American option:*</a> An American option is an option that can be exercised any time during its life, and not only at its expiration. American options allow holders to exercise the option at any time prior to and including its maturity date, thus increasing the value of the option to the holder relative to otherwise identical European options, which can only be exercised at maturity. The majority of exchange-traded options on single stocks are American, while options on indexes tend to be European style.
