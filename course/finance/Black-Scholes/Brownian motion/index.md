#Brownian motion

---

 - *Standard Brownian motion:* A stochastic process $\lbrace X(t), ~ t \geslant 0 \rbrace$ is said to be a standard Brownian motion process if
 $$ \begin{aligned}
 \text{(i)} ~ & ~ X(0) = 0 ~; \\\\
 \text{(ii)} ~ & ~ \lbrace X(t), ~ t \geqslant 0 \text{ has stationary and independent increments, in that the distribution of $X(s+t) - X(t)$ does not depend on $t$, and for all $t\_1 < t\_2 < ... < t\_n$, the increments $X(t\_n) - X(t\_{n-1})$, $X(t\_{n-1}) - X(t\_{n-2})$, ..., $X(t\_2) - X(t\_1)$, $X(t\_1)$ are independent;} \\\\
 \text{(iii)} ~ & ~ \text{for every $t > 0$, $X(t)$ is normally distributed with mean $0$ and variance $t$.}
