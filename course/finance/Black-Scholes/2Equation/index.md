# The Black-Scholes Equation

> $$ \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + rS \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0 $$
> where
> $V = V(S,t)$ is the price of the option as a function of the stock price $S$ and time $t$,  
> $r$ is the risk-free interest rate, and $\sigma$ is the volatility of the stock.
