# The Black-Scholes Equation

> $$ \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} + rS \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} - rV = 0 ~, $$
> where
> $V = V(S,t)$ is the price of the option as a function of the stock price $S$ and time $t$,  
> $r$ is the risk-free interest rate, and $\sigma$ is the volatility of the stock.

## Derivation:

The underlying assumption to Black and Scholes' work is that the underlying stock price $S$ follos a geometric Brownian motion with drift $\mu$ and variance parameter $\sigma^2$:

 - *Brownian motion with drift:* A stochastic process $\lbrace X(t), t \geqslant 0 \rbrace$ is said to be a Brownian motion process with drift coefficient $\mu$ and variance paramter $\sigma^2$ if  
(i) $X(0) = 0$;  
(ii) $\lbrace X(t), t \geqslant 0 \rbrace$ has stationary and independent increments, in that the distribution of $X(t+s) - X(t)$ does not depend on $t$, and for all $t\_1 < t\_2 < ... < t\_n$, the increments $X(t\_n) - X(t\_{n-1}), X(t\_{n-1}) - X(t\_{n-2}), ..., X(t\_2) - X(t\_1)$, and $X(t\_1)$ are independent;  
(iii) for every $t > 0$, $X(t)$ is normally distributed with mean $\mu t$ and variance $\sigma^2 t$.

 - *Geometric Brownian motion:* If $\lbrace Y(t), t \geqslant 0 \rbrace$ is a Brownian motion process with drift coefficient $\mu$ and variance paramter $\sigma^2$, then the process $\lbrace X(t), t \geqslant 0 \rbrace$ defined by $X(t) = e^{Y(t)}$ is called geometric Brownian motion.

In the language of stochastic calculus, Black and Scholes' assumption is that

$$ dS = \mu S dt + \sigma S dW $$

where $W$ is a Brownian motion. Note that $W$ (and hence $dW$) is the only source of uncertainty here. Now with reagrds to $V(S,t)$, a particular result in stochastic calculus, It√¥'s lemma, gives
$$ dV = \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \mu S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial ^2 V}{\partial S^2}\right) dt + \sigma S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} dW ~. $$

Now we introduce a hedged portfolio: suppose a particular agent is short one option (with value $V$), and goes long on $\frac{\partial V}{\partial S}$ shares at time $t$, then the value $\Pi$ of these holdings is

$$ \Pi = -V + \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} S ~, $$

and over a time interval of length $\Delta t$, the profit (or loss) from changes in value of the holdings is

$$ \Delta \Pi = -\Delta V + \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} \Delta S ~. $$

Discretising the expressions for $dS$ and $dV$, we get

$$
\Delta S &= \mu S \Delta t + \sigma S \Delta W \\\\
\Delta V &= \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} + \mu S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 S^2 \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial S^2} \rght) \Delta t + \sigma S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S} \Delta W ~,
$$

and substituting these into the expression for $\Delta \Pi$ we find
