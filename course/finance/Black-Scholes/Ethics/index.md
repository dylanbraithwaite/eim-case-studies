> "The financial sector was quick to see the advantages of the Black-Scholes equation and its solutions, and equally quick to develop a host of related equations with different assumptions aimed at different financial instruments. The then-sedate world of conventional banking could use the equations to justify loans and trades, always keeping an eye open for potential trouble. But less conventional businesses would soon follow, and they had the faith of a true convert. To them, the possibility of the model going wrong was inconceivable. It became known as the Midas formula - a recipe for making everything turn to gold. But the financial sector forgot how the story of King Midas ended."  

> "The Black-Scholes equation changed the world by creating a booming quadrillion-dollar industry; its generalisations, used unintelligently by a small coterie of bankers, changed the world again by contributing to a multitrillion-dollar financial crash whose ever more malign effects, now extending to entire national economics, are still being felt worldwide. The equation belongs to the realm of classical continuum mechanics, having its roots in the partial differential equations of mathematical phyiscs. This is a realm in which quantities are infinitely divisible, time flows continuously, and variables change smoothly. The technique works for mathematical physics, but it seems less appropriate to the world of finance, in which money comes in discrete packets, trades occur one at a time (albeit very fast), and many variables can jump erratically."

# The Ethics

consider the following:

 - Who takes responsibilty for mathematical tools, that is who *takes credit* for them?
 - Who is responsible for *the use* of mathematical tools?
 - Who is responsible for the *misuse* of mathematical tools?

> "Was an equation to blame for the financial crash then?  
> An equation is a tool, and liek any tool, it has to be wielded by someone who knows how to use it, and for the right purpose. The Black-Scholes equation may have contributed to the crash, but only because it was abused. It was no more responsible for the disaster than a trader's computer would have been if its use led to a catastrophic loss. The blame for the failure of tools should rest with those who are responsible for their use. There is a danger that the financial sector may turn its back on mathematical analysis, when what it actually needs is a better range of models, and - crucially - a solid understanding of their limitations. The financial system is too complex to be run on human hunches and vague reasoning. It desperately needs *more* mathematics, not less. But it also needs to learn how to use mathematics intelligently, rather than as some kind of magical talisman."

- Consider the story of Cassandra, the mythological Greek prophet with the gift of perfect prophecy, but cursed so that she was never believed.  
As a collective, mathematicians have an awesome potential for prediction with mathematical models; but this is meaningless unless people trust the models, that is unless people *believe* them. Mathematicians therefore have a duty to ...
