> "The financial sector was quick to see the advantages of the Black-Scholes equation and its solutions, and equally quick to develop a host of related equations with different assumptions aimed at different financial instruments. The then-sedate worls of conventional banking could use the equations to justify loans and trades, always keeping an eye open for potential trouble. But less conventional businesses would soon follow, and they had the faith of a true convert. To them, the possibility of the model going wrong was inconceivable. It became known as the Midas formula - a recipe for making everything turn to gold. But the financial sector forgot how the story of King Midas ended."  
> "The Black-Scholes equation changed the world by creating a booming quadrillion-dollar industry; its generalisations, used unintelligently by a small coterie of bankers, changed the world again by contributing to a multitrillion-dollar financial crash whose ever more malign effects, now extending to entire national economics, are still being felt worldwide. The equation belongs to the realm of classical continuum mechanics, having its roots in the partial differential equations of mathematical phyiscs. This is a realm in which quantities are infinitely divisible, time flows continuously, and variables change smoothly. The technique works for mathematical physics, but it seems less appropriate to the world of finance, in which money comes in discrete packets, trades occur one at a time (albeit very fast), and many variables can jump erratically."
