# What is Quantitative Easing?

Quantitative Easing (QE) is the implementation of **Large-Scale Asset Purchase**, a system by which the central bank of a country prints physical or electronic money to purchase assets from the private sector. This increases the amount of money in circulation, encouraging investment and boosting the economy (Table 1). This is an unconventional method of stimulating the economy, and is employed as a solution to the **Zero Lower Bound Problem** (ZLBP).

### The Zero Lower Bound Problem

When an economy becomes unstable or when interest rate is too low, the central bank wants to reduce the bank rate in order to stimulate the economy. However, when the bank rate is near $0\%$, this becomes a problem. A bank cannot actually take the interest rate to 0%, even if it wants to – there would then be no incentive to save money in the bank. In such a case, it is necessarily left stuck at its lower bound, quite unable to help. This is where solutions to the ZLBP come in, such as employing negative interest rate through taxing currency, but most commonly by employing QE. Note that thus increasing demand in the economy leads to a rise in the equilibrium price level, increasing the rate of inflation; as such, if the nominal interest rate is low, the effective interest rate can be brought below zero (since the money is effectively losing value, yet it is losing it slower than it would were it not held in a bank).

In 2009 the Bank of England began its QE program by buying £75bn worth of assets from the private sector. The Federal Reserve 
(the central bank of the United States) began their project QE1 in 2008, purchasing $600bn worth of assets.
