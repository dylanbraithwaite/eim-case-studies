## Central Bank Rate
$\newcommand{\c}[1]{^{[#1]}}\newcommand{\C}[2]{^{[#1\text{, p.#2}]}}\newcommand{\Ci}[2]{^{[#1\text{, #2}]}}$
The central bank governs a central bank rate that reflects the interest rate paid on assets held by commercial banks at the central bank. Therefore, the interest rate set by the central bank will reflect the interest rate of borrowing and saving for general bank accounts in commercial banks.

## Committees of Central Banks

### The Monetary Policy Committee

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is the body that governs decisions regarding the bank rate in the Bank of England. During the time of the Global Financial Crash, the MPC voted the bank rate down from $5\%$ to $0.5\%$ in the course of 11 months to stimulate the economy. The bank rate remained at $\leq0.5\%$ for the next **9 years** until 2018/08/02 when the MPC voted to raise it to $0.75\%$.$\c{1}$

In 2009, the MPC had nine members:

* Mervyn King (Governor)
* Rachel Lomax (Deputy Governor)
* John Gieve (Deputy Governor)
* Charles Bean (Chief Economist)
* Kate Barker
* Paul Tucker
* Tim Besley
* David Blanchflower (External Member)
* Andrew Sentance (External Member)

Of these members, only **Paul Tucker** had any substantial mathematical training, having studied Maths and Philosophy at Trinity College, Cambridge.$\c{2}$ One may presume that Tucker therefore has a unique insight into macroeconomics, but voting records from the Bank of England show that in voting Tucker never swayed from the majority.$\c{3}$

The 2009 Q2 bulletin$\c{4}$ has a telling statement that indicates there was little technical work in deciding to employ QE:

 > "It is too soon to say how powerful the stimulus will ultimately be. There is considerable uncertainty about the strength and timing of effects. **Standard economic models are of limited use in these unusual circumstances**, and the empirical evidence is extremely limited. However, the monetary policy framework will ensure that the appropriate measures are taken over time so that the inflation target is met in the medium term."

### The Federal Open Market Commitee

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is the body responsible for the decision to begin Large-Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) programs,$\c{5}$ and in December 2008 lowered the federal funds rate to 0-25 basis points (each one ten thousandth, so 100bp=1%). This rubbed up close to the zero lower bound, and so the FOMC decided to begin LSAP.
