> The model is an attempt to disprove Wallace's Irrelevance Theorem$\c{1}$ using the same model employed in that paper to show that DSGE is functional.

> To give LSAP a chance, the model will limit arbitrage and market segmentation in a simple, frictionless form. DSGE will be augmented with nominal and real rigidities.

Arbitrage is the existence of a single item being priced differently by two different agents in the market. When the difference is high enough, other agents can buy up stock from the cheaper supplier and sell it to the other. While arbitrage occasionally appears in markets, any significant amount of it typically collapses as both suppliers alter their prices.

> It is assumed that investors have heterogeneous preferences for assets of different maturities and that risk premium is a positive function of long-term treasury securities.

Investors in some models are considered homogenous in their interest - that all investors want basically the same thing. This is not necesarially true, as some will be more risky or try to only invest in housing etc. Therefore, MELP's model uses heterogeneous preferences. The risk premium's presence says that investors, capital producers, households etc consider a premium maturing later in time to be a risky concept, and so will reduce the value of a bond for this reason.

> In the model, long-term interest rate matters for aggregate demand distinct from the expected short-term rates. The result is even if short-term rate isconstrained by ZLB for a long period of time, monetary policy can still be effective by directly influencing long-term rates.

The decoupling of long-term interest rates and short-term will allow the stimulation of long-term rates. While the short-term econoy at the time of the paper (2011) was doing *not very well* the point of LSAP was to stimulate the economy in a small, consistent way to help it grow.

> The model is estimated using a Bayesian method, using post-war data.

Bayesian statistics makes assumptions about the distribution of a random variable (of which DSGE has many) and then using data about readings to produce a posterior distribution that more accurately reflects the nature of the variable. The second world war was an exceptional time for global economy, so data is used from after then.
