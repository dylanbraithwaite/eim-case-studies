> The model is an attempt to disprove Wallace's Irrelevance Theorem$\c{1}$ using the same model employed in that paper to show that DSGE is functional.

> To give LSAP a chance, the model will limit arbitrage and market segmentation in a simple, frictionless form. DSGE will be augmented with nominal and real rigidities.

> It is assumed that investors have heterogeneous preferences for assets of different maturities and that risk premium is a positive function of long-term treasury securities.

> In the model, long-term interest rate matters for aggregate demand distinct from the expected short-term rates. The result is even if short-term rate isconstrained by ZLB for a long period of time, monetary policy can still be effective by directly influencing long-term rates.

> The model is estimated using a Bayesian method, using post-war data.
