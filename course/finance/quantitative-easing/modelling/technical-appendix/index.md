This technical appendix will be based on analysing the particular flavour of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) used in Chen et al 2011.$\c{1}$ The model was employed to analyse how Large-Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) would affect the US economy.

## [Model Methods](/course/course/finance/quantitative-easing/modelling/technical-appendix/methods)

The model is an attempt to disprove [Wallace's Irrelevance Theorem](/course/course/finance/quantitative-easing/modelling/technical-appendix/wallace)$\c{2}$ using the same model employed in that paper to show that DSGE is functional. To give LSAP a chance, the model will limit arbitrage and market segmentation in a simple, frictionless form. DSGE will be augmented with nominal and real rigidities. It is assumed that investors have heterogeneous preferences for assets of different maturities and that risk premium is a positive function of long-term treasury securities. In the model, long-term interest rate matters for aggregate demand distinct from the expected short-term rates. The result is even if short-term rate isconstrained by ZLB for a long period of time, monetary policy can still be effective by directly influencing long-term rates. The model is estimated using a Bayesian method, using post-war data.

AGENTS ETC (this is where the maths is)

## [Empirical Analysis](/course/course/finance/quantitative-easing/modelling/technical-appendix/empirical-analysis)

The model is estimated with Bayesian methods$\F{2}. The likelyhood is constructed using the 'Kalman filter', based on the state space representation of the rational expectations solution of the model. The [data](/course/course/finance/quantitative-easing/modelling/technical-appendix/empirical-analysis) is obtained from after the end of WWII until the third quarter of 2009, although other end points are used to gauge the stability of the model. Once the model is run, [posterior distribution](/course/course/finance/quantitative-easing/modelling/technical-appendix/empirical-analysis/posterior-distribution)s are created and the outcome is used to forecast the economy.

## Simulating LSAP II

The first round of LSAP, QE1, in which the US government began purchasing securities from late November 2008 until June 2010.$\F{1}$ The second round of LSAP, QE2 (in MELP it is called LSAP II), was announced in November 2010 which ended by June 2011. MELP, originally released December 2011, seeks to emulate the effects of LSAP II. An assumption made is that the government will purchase assets over 2 years, hold for 2 years and then sell assets over 2 years. However, this is not what happened. QE3, also called QE$\infty$, is an open-ended asset purchase program that currently includes purchasing $85 billion of assets per month indefinitely.

## Conclusions

# Footnotes

$\F{1}$ The government continued to buy smaller amounts of assets, $30 a month, from August 2010 to keep nominal holdings constant.

$\F{2}$ Since $\exists$ information on the variables presented this method is appropriate. The Bayesian method takes existing ideas about something's distribution and transforms it into the posterior distribution.
