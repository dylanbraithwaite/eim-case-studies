This technical appendix will be based on analysing the particular flavour of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) used in Chen et al 2011.$\c{1}$ The model was employed to analyse how Large-Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) would affect the US economy.

## Model Methods

The model will estimate the effects of LSAP using a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model, as is in Wallace’s irrelevance theorem.$\c{2}$ To give LSAP a chance, the model will limit arbitrage and market segmentation in a simple, frictionless form. DSGE will be augmented with nominal and real rigidities. It is assumed that investors have heterogeneous preferences for assets of different maturities and that risk premium is a positive function of long-term treasury securities. In the model, long-term interest rate matters for aggregate demand distinct from the expected short-term rates. The result is even if short-term rate isconstrained by ZLB for a long period of time, monetary policy can still be effective by directly influencing long-term rates. The model is estimated using a Bayesian method, using post-war data.
