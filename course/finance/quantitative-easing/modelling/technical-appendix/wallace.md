# Wallace's Irrelevance Theorem

In his 1981 paper$\c{1}$ Niel Wallace showed that government intervention in times of economic stress cannot change the conditions of the economy - that government policy is *irrelevant*. This is of great concern to the authors of MELP, who are acting under direct order of the [Federal Reserve](https://www.federalreserve.gov/), the central bank of the US. As part of their program to hel boost the economy with LSAP after the financial crash, MELP was published.

By making certain key assumptions that alter Wallace's DSGE model, MELP predicted that LSAP will have minor, but lasting effects on the economy's health - GDP growth, real value of bonds etc. The most keen variable of interest is $\omega\_u$ - the proportion of *unrestricted* [households](/course/course/finance/quantitative-easing/modelling/technical-appendix/agents/households). The distinction between restricted and unrestricted households is used to create a friction that breaks the irrelevance theorem.
