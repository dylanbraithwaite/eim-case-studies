# Libor Scandal

"LIBOR: Origins, Economics, Crisis, Scandal,
and Reform [1]" gives a detailed account of the history of Libor. In 2007, regulators and market 
observers began to notice that Libor was not behaving as expected compared to other market prices and rates. Investigations by 
U.S and other foreign regulators found that banks were purposefully influencing the Libor fixings in order to make the financial 
market appear to be healthier than it actually was. Deutsche Bank, Barclays, UBS, Rabobank, HSBC, Bank of America, Citigroup, 
JPMorgan Chase, the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi, Credit Suisse, Lloyds, WestLB, and the Royal Bank of Scotland were prominent 
banks in the scandal, among others [2]. Deutsche Bank paid the largest fine for Libor rigging, 
which amounted to $2.5bn (Â£1.7bn) [3].

Regarding the 2008 scandal, Scott Peng was the first within the financial business to publish a report questioning the 
integrity of Libor. He wrote "Is Libor Broken?" [4] on 10th April 2008. He started out creating 
financial instruments for the Lehman brothers [5,p.179] before going to work for the investment 
bank Citigroup as a researcher where he wrote the report. On 16th April 2008, just six days after Peng's report, an article 
entitled "Libor Fog: Bankers Cast Doubt On Key Rate Amid Crisis" was published by Wall street 
Journal [6]. The article opens with:

  *"One of the most important barometers of the world's financial health could be sending false signals. 
  In a development that has implications for borrowers everywhere, from Russian oil producers to homeowners
  in Detroit, bankers and traders are expressing concerns that the London inter-bank offered rate, known as
  Libor, is becoming unreliable."*


This was the first time the public were made aware that there was an issue with Libor.

One of the main issues with Libor is that it relies on banks telling the truth. The concern is that if banks 
report a high interest rate, then they tip off others that they are in desperate need of cash, and makes them 
look weak compared to their competitors.

The first graph illustrates the change in the USD Libor rates of different maturities over 30 years [7]. 
The second graph shows the USD Libor rate spanning the time of the financial crash in 2008 [8] - the Libor rates rise when banks
are in trouble. Libor should remain at a fairly constant level, like at the left and right, however we can see
that this is not the case while manipulation was happening. 


Additionally, individual bankers could make a lot of money on their trades by tweaking Libor a tiny bit,
as discussed earlier. "In more recent times, there was a temptation to rig rates because there is such a 
huge derivatives market with billions and billions of pounds of trades linked to Libor," explains David Potter, 
a former Midland Bank and Samuel Montagu director whose long career in finance goes back to the 1960s. 
"So with just a 0.001 percent tweak, that can make serious money [9]."
