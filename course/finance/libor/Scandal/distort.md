# How much did manipulation distort Libor?

The findings of the paper by Youle entitled ["How much did manipulation distort Libor"](youleHowMuchDid2014) 
are that Libor was largely accurate prior to the financial crisis starting in
late 2007, but was since distorted downwards by eight basis points, which amounts to 0.08%. 
This is considered to be a substantial change given the volume of contracts affected. 
Those manipulating also consistently made large profits due to single basis point changes. 
An an example U.S municipalities held $\$500$ billion worth of interest rate swaps in 2010, 
bought with taxpayer money. Youle calculates they would have lost $\$455$ million from this 
eight basis point shift over the sample period used.

The document notes that manipulation would not have been possible if it had just been one 
bank attempting to change the Libor rate because only the middle 50% of submissions are 
used to determine Libor's value. It is clear that many of the banks contributing to Libor 
were also contributing to its manipulation.
