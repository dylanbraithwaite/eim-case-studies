# The Future of Libor

A document entitled ``ICE Libor Evolution" published April 25, 2018 gives detail on how Libor 
has changed since 2008 [1]. 

After the financial scandal involving Libor in 2008, HM Treasury commissioned Martin Wheatley, 
who was the CEO-designate of the FCA (Financial Conduct Authority), to establish an independent 
review into Libor [2]. In his review, Wheatley lays out many points
for reform of Libor. One point was that responsibility for Libor should be transferred from the
BBA to a private organisation. Therefore, in April 2013, Libor came under the administration of 
the FCA. Soon after, in February 2014, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (“IBA”) was recommended 
and accepted as the new administrator. 

It is important to note that there were complaints about the inaccuracy of Libor as early as
2007 \cite{ConcernsLiborRate2012}. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a US regulator, 
started investigating in May 2008. In spring 2010, the UK Financial Conduct Authority got involved. 
Barclays was the first bank to be fined in 2012 [3]. Hayes 
didn't have his trial until 2015. Libor will still be in use until at least 2021. This shows how
slow the investigations into Libor were, and how long it will take to fix.

In terms of reform to Libor, the IBA has developed a revised code of conduct for the Panel Banks. 
It sets out a framework within which Panel Banks operate and make submissions. The IBA also maintains 
an oversight committee for Libor who review the methodology, scope and definition of Libor, oversee 
changes and oversee and review the code of conduct.

Since 2008, the main aim has been to make a step towards a transaction-based Libor value instead of 
a subjective value. 

Most recently IBA appears to be focussing on the submission stage of the Libor process.

The diagram shows IBA's Libor reform [1]. Note that steps two and beyond are the same.


The idea behind the new `Waterfall Methodology' is that if a panel bank has sufficient eligible
transactions, a volume weighted average price will be calculated and used for their submission,
this is known as a level 1 submission. If a panel banks doesn't have sufficient eligible transactions 
to make a level 1 submission, they will make a submission based on transaction-derived data, known as 
a level 2 submission. Otherwise, it will submit the rate at which it could fund itself at 11:00am London
time with reference to the unsecured, wholesale funding market, known as a level 3 submission. Each Panel 
Bank agrees its defined level 3 submission methodology with IBA. The level 3 submission appears to be very 
similar to the current submission protocol.

After 2021, the future of Libor is in doubt. The UK Financial Conduct Authority has advised that its 
intention is that it would no longer be necessary to sustain LIBOR through its influence or legal powers 
beyond this time [1]. In June 2017, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee
(ARRC) identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative to USD 
Libor [4]. One of the issues with replacing Libor is that there
are a large number of financial contracts which rely on Libor and come into maturity after 2021. 
Therefore IBA hopes continue to publish the LIBOR rates alongside the alternative `risk-free rates'
that are being developed.

SOFR is a broad measure of overnight Treasury financing transactions and according to the Federal 
Reserve Bank of New York, characteristics of SOFR are [4]:

- fully transaction based (underlying transactions of about \$700 billion per day or more)
- encompasses a robust underlying market
- overnight, nearly risk-free \footnote{This is the wording used by the Federal Reserve Bank of New 
	York. They don't define what this means.} reference rate that correlates closely with other
	money market rates
- covers multiple repo market segments allowing for future market evolution


However, SOFR has some distinct challenges compared to Libor. Firstly, it is a secured rate whereas Libor is an 
unsecured rate [5]. This is important because Libor is used to reflect the unsecured borrowing 
rates of banks, the secured borrowing rates are lower than the unsecured rates. Secondly, SOFR is only an
overnight rate, whereas Libor currently covers 7 different loan periods. The Federal Reserve will start publishing 
SOFR rates this year. I think more research is required to make a judgement on whether or not it is likely to be
the `fix' that is required, but it appears that it will be more robust, if less useful. 

Additionally, it is not just London that has an interbank offered rate, in Brussels there is Eurobor 
(based on the Euro), Japan uses Tibor, Hong Kong has Hibor, Singapore has Sibor, Hungary has Bubor and 
South Africa has Jibor, just to name a few. These work in a very similar way to Libor. This begs the question, 
are these rates undergoing the same problems as Libor has done in the last decade?
