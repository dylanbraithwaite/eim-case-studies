# What is Libor?

Libor is widely used to determine the health of various financial systems [1,p.1]. 
Libor serves two primary purposes, it acts as a reference rate and a benchmark rate. A reference rate is an
interest rate that determines other interest rates. A benchmark rate is a relative performance measure. In 
this sense, Libor gives an indication of the health of the world's financial markets. Libor is considered to be the 
most dominant and widely recognised benchmark rate in the world [2]. The total value of contracts 
primarily using Libor as a reference rate have been estimated to be more than $350 trillion [3,p.2]. 
This shows just how important Libor is to the world's financial markets.  


In April 2008 the first report appeared suggesting that banks had been misreporting figures to those who calculate 
Libor [4], and hence causing the value of Libor to not accurately reflect the situation of the 
financial market. Interestingly, in Libor's early days, in the mid-1980s it was recognised that there was incentive for
banks to underreport, and therefore in 1986 the British Bankers' Association (BBA) took control to govern the process.
BBA was still nominally responsible for Libor at the time of the scandal and in the few years afterwards, before being
taken over by Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration Limited, changing it to ICE LIBOR in 2014 [5]. 

The use of Libor has changed since the scandal of 2008. We will first look at how it was used prior to the scandal, 
and then look at the consequences financially and how the use of Libor changed. 

Donald MacKenzie (his research on trading is currently funded by the UK Economic and Social Research Council) wrote
about the use and importance of Libor in September 2008 [6]. Each day just after 11am, 35 Libors
are calculated, one for each of 5 currencies over 7 loan time periods. The currencies used are the U.S. dollar
(USD), euro (EUR), pound sterling (GBP), Japanese yen (JPY), and Swiss franc (CHF) and the maturities are overnight, 
one week, and 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months [2]. Prior to 2008, 150 Libors were calculated each day, 
but this has since been scaled down. About sixteen of the largest and most creditworthy banks are asked  "At what rate 
could you borrow funds, were you to do so by asking for and then accepting interbank offers in a reasonable market 
size just prior to 11am? [7,p.1]” for each currency-maturity pair.Then for each pair, 
the responses are listed in order, the bottom and top quarters are discarded, and the remaining values are averaged to
give the Libor fixing for that pair [1,p.1]. 

In his 2008 article entitled "What's in a number?" [6], David MacKenzie said

\begin{center}
	\textit{Note the conditional: a Libor input is what a bank could do, not what it has done. So judgment is involved.
  A bank might not have borrowed anything in the minutes before 11 a.m. Deals for longer than overnight are intermittent,
  and there is little borrowing at some of the time periods involved, such as 11 months. ‘Reasonable market size’ is 
  deliberately not defined exactly: it will vary from currency to currency and according to time period and market conditions. 
  The need for judgement is why the information provided by brokers is important to the calculation of Libor. It helps a bank’s
  traders to estimate the rate at which they could borrow money, even if they’re not trying to do so.}
\end{center}

After the scale of the Libor scandal was revealed, there was a call for make the definition on Libor less ambiguous, namely 
from a document entitled "Recommendations for Enhancing the Credibility of LIBOR" by "FRBNY Markets and Research and
Statistics Groups" [8]. As well as recommending a revision of the
definition of Libor, they suggest eliminating incentive to misreport results by not publicising banks whose reports fall 
above or below the midrange. This means that nobody would know whether a bank fell in the top or bottom quarter, therefore
making it less clear whether the bank is struggling or not.
