# Swaps

One of the things that Libor is used for is interest rate swaps. The most commonly traded and most 
liquid interest rate swaps are known as “vanilla” swaps, which exchange fixed-rate payments for 
floating-rate payments based on Libor [1]. Vanilla swaps constitute the vast majority of the market. 

The 'swap rate' is the fixed interest rate that the receiver demands in exchange for the uncertainty 
of having to pay the short-term Libor (floating) rate over time.
