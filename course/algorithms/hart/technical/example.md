# Example of branch creation

Consider a tree that tries to determine if a number is prime. The sample has been picked (with replacement) from a large database of integers and the attributes shown are those that have been picked (without replacement) from the set of attributes in the integer database.

## Formulae

$$\text{Entropy}(S)=-p\_\oplus\log\_2(p\_\oplus)-p\_\ominus\log\_2(p\_\ominus)$$

$$\text{Gain}(S,A)=\text{Entropy}(S)-\sum\_{v\in\text{values}(A)}\left(\frac{|S\_v|}{|S|}\centerdot\text{Entropy}(S\_v)\right)$$
