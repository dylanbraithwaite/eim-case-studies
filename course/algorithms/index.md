Algorithms are currently a huge part of our digital society, and their role in the world at large is only increasing. We are  not only seeing algorithms as a means to make better search engines or determine where planes should fly, but also seeing their use in law. HART and COMPAS are two such algorithms which have been designed to help police determine the risk associated with a suspect.

The issue arises that if an algorithm is based on past conviction data, or past recidivism data, and this data is biased, then the algorithm will learn to be biased. Mathematicians have stepped in and tried to determine how to prove mathematically that an algorithm is fair or not, through various mathematical criteria. Philosophers have argued for millennia over what it means to be fair, and the argument is far from over. Now mathematicians, often with little ethical training, are wading in to the debate, trying to set fairness on a rigorous foundation â€“ can we ensure that they are doing so responsibly?
