PredPol is a predictive policing tool make by PredPol, Inc. It seeks to
optimise resources used by a police force by predicting hotspots of
crime. It uses only exactly the data points of

-   Crime type
-   Crime location
-   Crime date & time

It then plots several $150\text{m}\times150{\text m}$ red boxes on a
grid on Google maps to show where it predicts crime will occur.
PredPol’s website background$\c{1}$ shows an example
of what this might look like.

A glaring issue to be found with PredPol is that it has the potential to
create a feedback loop that punishes against already targetted areas and
minorities. A police force that has historically found a lot of crime in
an area is not necessarily indicative of that area being higher in crime
than others. Many police forces excessively target black communities and
are more prone to violence and arresting black people. Therefore, crime
statistics will show that those areas have more crime. More police are
sent there and so more crime is found – the cycle continues. O’Niel
