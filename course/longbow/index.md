# Archers and Mathematicians

---

> (1363) The King \[Edward III\] to the Lord-lieutenant of Kent, greeting:  
> Whereas the people of our realm, rich and poor alike, were accustomed formerly in their games to practise archery - whence by God's help, it is well known that high honour and profit came to our realm, and no small advantage to ourselves in our warlike enterprises - and that now skill in the use of the bow having fallen almost wholly into disrepute, our subjects give themselves up to the throwing of stones and of wood and of iron; and some to handball and football and hockey; and others to coursing and cockfights, and even to other unseemly sports less useful and manly; whereby our realm - which God forbid - will soon, it would appear, be void of archers:  
> We, wishing that a fitting remedy be found in this matter, do hereby ordain, that in all places in your country, liberties or no liberties, wheresoever you shall deem fit, a proclamation be made to this effect: that every man in the same county, if he be able-bodied, shall upon holidays, make use, in his games, of bows and arrows ... and so learn and practise archery.  
> Moreover we ordain that you prohibit under penalty of imprisonment all and sundry from such stone, wood and iron throwing; handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting; or other such idle games.

## Longbow at the battle of Agincourt

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the English kings heavily encouraged boys and men to practise archery, to the extent of banning all other sports because they diverted time from archery. Archers were known to be valuable in a war, and were used to great effect on the battlefields of CrÃ©cy, Poitiers, and Agincourt (to name but a few); in each battle the English armies were outnumbered but still gained victory, thanks in part to skillful use of their longbow archers. And fielding great numbers of archers for a war was far easier to do when every boy from a young age was obliged to practise at least once a week - with competitions adding monetary incentives to turn this practice into training.

An important point to this is that bows - especially longbows - were not weapons that just anyone could use. An account from 12th-century Wales illustrates just how powerful they were:

> ... one of the men of arms was struck by an arrow shot at him by a Welshman. It went right through his thigh, high up, where it was protected inside and outside the leg by his iron cuirasses, and then though the skirt of his leather tunic; next it penetrated that part of the saddle which is called the alva or seat; and finally it lodged in his horse, driving so deep that it killed the animal.

~ Gerald of Wales, 1191

Arrows, then, could puncture plate armor. To use these powerful bows, archers often had to train for their entire lives - devoting their time to very little else - and this left its mark on the archer. Longbowman's skeletons from the time can actually be identified by the damage done to their bones; defects appear along the shoulder blades, wrists, and elbows. Having to draw hundreds of pounds of force every day strained their bodies so much that some skeletons even have extra bone that had grown to compensate: the discipline physically changed them.

Another important point is one of chivalry, or ethics if you like: archers didn't train in combat against an opposition, so there was no need for a code of chivalry, and this had devastating consequences for the french facing Henry V at the battle of Agincourt.

According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica:

> Henry drew up his army where the road to Calais passed through thick woods. It had been raining hard for several days and the fields on either side were newly plowed. Placing his archers on either flank, with more archers and dismounted knights in the center, he hammered rows of pointed stakes into the road. Confronted by this narrow battlefield, the French formed up into three battles or divisions, one behind the other, the first two consisting of dismounted men with some crossbowmen, the third mostly mounted men.
>
> At first the two armies faced each other down the road, probably about 1 mile (1.6 km) apart. The French knew of Henry's youthful enthusiasm and hoped he might attack them first. Henry, however, decided to force a French attack and moved his army forward a short distance. The trick worked, for, unable to control his eager men, the French Constable ordered an attack. As the first French battle advanced, mounted knights from either flank galloped past them toward the English lines. Under intense fire from the English archers and hampered by the weight of their armor, the muddy ground, and the rows of stakes, they were soon in trouble. This initial cavalry attack had been completely repulsed before the first battle arrived on foot. Fighting their way through to the English line, they were then attacked by the English archers wielding axes, swords, and daggers in close combat. Within minutes the entire first battle had been killed or captured. The second French battle then surged forward but fell back with heavy losses.
>
> At this point Henry received reports that his camp a mile to the rear was under attack. In reality, this was just a group of peasants out for plunder but, knowing that his small army could not fight on two fronts and guard the many prisoners, Henry ordered all French prisoners to be killed.

Henry ordered the slaughter of perhaps several thousand French prisoners, and a slaughter did ensue. The knights found it contrary to chivalry (and against their interests to kill valuable hostages, who would usually be ransomed). But Henry threatened to hang whoever did not obey his orders, and the archers obeyed, with the number of French knights killed likely reaching the hundreds before the reserves fled the field and Henry called an end to the slaughter.

## Mathematicians

Compare the training and upbringing of a longbow archer to that of a mathematician, which also requires focused practice from a young age. Mathematics is a very powerful tool in modern society, making mathematicians highly valued and sought-after. Mathematicians are very good at their trade because they will have practised some form of numeracy regularly since as early as ages 3-4, with each academic year building upon the last. And for those students that really take to it (those mathematicians to be), it pervasively changes the way their mind functions and how they consider the world. Mathematicians see patterns in the world where others may not, they develop an affinity for 'nice' solutions, and they explain complex phenomena by reducing them to axiomatised systems. And mathematics is taught with such abstraction from the real world that its effects are rarely considered: it is done with no code of conduct.
