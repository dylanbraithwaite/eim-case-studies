# Archers and Mathematicians

> (1363) The King \[Edward III\] to the Lord-lieutenant of Kent, greeting:  
> Whereas the people of our realm, rich and poor alike, were accustomed formerly in their games to practise archery - whence by God's help, it is well known that high honour and profit came to our realm, and no small advantage to ourselves in our warlike enterprises - and that now skill in the use of the bow having fallen almost wholly into disrepute, our subjects give themselves up to the throwing of stones and of wood and of iron; and some to handball and football and hockey; and others to coursing and cockfights, and even to other unseemly sports less useful and manly; whereby our realm - which God forbid - will soon, it would appear, be void of archers:  
> We, wishing that a fitting remedy be found in this matter, do hereby ordain, that in all places in your country, liberties or no liberties, wheresoever you shall deem fit, a proclamation be made to this effect: that every man in the same county, if he be able-bodied, shall upon holidays, make use, in his games, of bows and arrows ... and so learn and practise archery.  
> Moreover we ordain that you prohibit under penalty of imprisonment all and sundry from such stone, wood and iron throwing; handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting; or other such idle games.

## Longbow at the battle of Agincourt

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the English kings heavily encouraged boys and men to practise archery, to the extent of banning all other sports because they diverted time from archery. Archers were known to be valuable in a war, and were used to great effect on the battlefields of CrÃ©cy, Poitiers, and Agincourt (to name but a few); in each battle the English armies were outnumbered but still gained victory, thanks in part to skillful use of their longbow archers. And fielding great numbers of archers for a war was far easier to do when every boy from a young age was obliged to practise at least once a week - with competitions adding monetary incentives to turn this practice into training.

An important point to this is that bows (especially longbows) were not weapons that just anyone could use. An account from 12th century Wales illustrates just how powerful they were:

> one of the men of arms was struck by an arrow shot at him by a Welshman. It went right through his thigh, high up, where it was protected inside and outside the leg by his iron cuirasses, and then though the skirt of his leather tunic; next it penetrated that part of the saddle which is called the alva or seat; and finally it lodged in his horse, driving so deep that it killed the animal

~ Gerald of Wales, 1191

so arrows could puncture plate armor. To use these powerful bows, archers often had to train for their entire lives - devoting their time to very little else - and this left its mark on the archer. Longbowman's skeletons from the time can actually be identified by the damage done to their bones; defects appear along the shoulder blades, wrists, and elbows. Having to draw hundreds of pounds of force every day strained their bodies so much that some skeletons even have extra bone that had grown to compensate: the discipline physically changed them.
