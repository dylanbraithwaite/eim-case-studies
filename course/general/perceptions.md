**The perception of mathematicians**

Barbeau (1990) writes that "probably no area of human activity is as afflicted as mathematics with a gap between the public perception of its nature and what its practitioners believe it to be", and I quite agree. Mathematics patently has an image problem of sorts, in that the layman will typically both 

- not know what mathematicians do;
- despise them for it anyway.

This no doubt sets in during one's schooldays, in which the miserably rigid nature of most school mathematics can kill with ease the entire interest of someone not strongly naturally inclined towards it. Most people begin to assume at this stage that mathematicians are slightly insane, unkempt, middle-class men who have vanishingly little relevance to their lives, if they should think about them at all; their work is apparently earnestly assumed to consist of solving equations and computing arithmetic with large numbers. This is discussed at length in the 2000 paper 'Investigating Pupils' Images of Mathematicians'. 

When mathematics is at all involved in something perceived as 'bad' – for instance in the Treasury report palaver, detailed in the Brexit notes – it is very often lumped in with it. It is said to be the mathematicians designing malicious algorithms, doing something nefarious with their malicious sums, even though blaming mathematics for it makes about as much sense as blaming the English language.

But enough ranting on the terrible state of the world. What implications does this have for ethics in maths? It links, I believe, quite tightly to the idea of mathematical communication, which possesses immense ethical importance. In one direction, yes, it would be wonderful if we could act to dispel these myths, for it would make it much easier to communicate mathematical ideas effectively, for instance during financial crashes or whatnot. However, in practice, such a grand social volte-face is probably impossible, and certainly impossible if mathematicians themselves seek to do it. There is a need, sad though it may be, to accept this broad social view of mathematics, and to take it into account when talking to people outside the walls of our ivory towers.
