**Introduction**

In 2017, a judge ruled that two military psychologists, James Mitchell and John Bruce Jessen, could face trial for their actions in the alleged torture of terrorism suspects in the wake of 9/11. Interestingly, however, they had never encountered the defendants, nor had they taken any active role in the alleged torture. Their involvement consisted of the drafting of a list of possible 'enhanced interrogation' methods, for which they received substantial remuneration as contractors. 

Interestingly, as recounted in a *New York Times* article in July 2017, both sides drew reference to legal decisions made during the aftermath of the Holocaust. For instance, the defendants raised the story of a high-level technician working at the firm which supplied Zyklon B to the death camps, who was acquitted by postwar judges since they had no credible method of individually stopping the supply; since the psychologists had at most provided the 'raw materials', as it were, for the torture, rather actually enacting it, they argued that they could not be held criminally liable.

The plaintiffs, however, pointed out that the owner of the company that produced Zyklon B *was*, in fact, held criminally liable. Although his actions had no direct effect on the Holocaust – it was the Nazis, ultimately, who decided to deploy the product in the gas chambers – the owner was ultimately hanged. It all hinges on the degree to which the psychologists' muddy involvement in the torture process was integral. Jessen's defence seemed almost Speeresque, claiming that “I deliberated with great, soulful torment about this, and obviously I concluded that it could be done safely or I wouldn’t have done it.”

This demonstrates how, even if one's work may seem entirely technical, however insulated one may appear to be from the active application, one may still be legally responsible. There is also the serious problem that technicians in situations like these may end up in a situation not unlike 'Stockholm syndrome' – they end up convincing themselves that their work is of no ethical concern in order to justify their actions, and rather than being merely detached, end up actively advocating for ethically questionable ends. Indeed, Mitchell has now become a professional speaker, earning large sums for speeches on the 'minds of those trying to destroy America'. It is an element of human psychology which, in settings such as this, one sees recurring again and again.
