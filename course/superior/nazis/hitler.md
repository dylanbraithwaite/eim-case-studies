Hitler’s views on mathematics were always antagonistic. He was clearly never very strong in the subject while at the Realschule in Steyr; in particular, it seems relevant that he was not permitted to graduate because he failed mathematics (though he later passed the exams some months later).

The sole clear reference he makes to mathematical education in Mein Kampf reads thus:

”It is a characteristic of our materialistic epoch that our scientific education shows a growing emphasis on what is real and practical: such subjects, for instance, as applied mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc. Of course they are necessary in an age that is dominated by industrial technology and chemistry, and where everyday life shows at least the external manifestations of these. But it is a perilous thing to base the general culture of a nation on the knowledge of these subjects. On the contrary, that general culture ought always to be directed towards ideals. It ought to be founded on the humanist disciplines and should aim at giving only the ground work of further specialized instruction in the various practical sciences. Otherwise we should sacrifice those forces that are more important for the preservation of the nation than any technical knowledge.”

It is, of course, easy to read too much into a single paragraph from what is a several-hundred-page, half-incoherent rant, but his intent here is obvious: while he understands the need for applied mathematics, he does not believe that it should form part of the backbone of general education. The implicit distinction between pure and applied mathematics is interesting: while it would seem to suggest a broad preference for the ’idealism’ of pure mathematics, it was the use of applied mathematics by people like Speer which would prove essential to the Nazi war effort, while pure mathematics rather fell apart. When Hitler came to change the German school curriculum, he substantially reduced the attention given to mathematics, though it seems probable that this was to give more time to his preferred topics – eugenics, history, German and so forth – rather than due to any factors intrinsic to mathematics as a subject.
