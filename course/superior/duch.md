**Introduction**

The actions of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s comprised one of the most horrendous genocides in the whole history of human ignominy. One of the most confusing aspects was that, although academics, professionals and eventually anyone with a rudimentary education were declared to be enemies of the state, the highest leaders of the government were rather intellectual people: Pol Pot, for instance, was known to harbour a love of French literature, and Comrade Duch had been a remarkably successful mathematics graduate in his youth. 

Duch was in charge of the Santebal, the government's 'internal security' service. In this capacity he was in charge of the central S-21 prison camp, from which prisoners were taken to be murdered in the Killing Fields. The atrocities committed under his command are beyond imagining: when ammunition ran out, babies were smashed to death against trees, men were beaten to death with crude farm implements. The inhumanity was total.

**Duch's trial**

At a relatively recent court case, Duch freely admitted that he was responsible for the murder of over 12,000 people as the head of the Khmer Rouge secret police and commandant of the S-21 security center CITE. On July 25, 2010, The Trial Chamber convicted Duch of crimes against humanity and war crimes and, recognizing the existence of “significant mitigating factors”, sentenced him to 35 years in prison. On appeal, the Supreme Court Chamber found that the trial verdict did not reflect the gravity of the crimes he committed and increased his sentence to life imprisonment. 

His attempt at defending himself in his trial was influenced by the case of Speer. He cried continually, he went penitentially to the Killing Fields, took meetings with victims: in short, he tried to make it seem that he was deeply remorseful. Yet he did not pull it off. Onlookers, seeking his obsession with calculation and incomprehension of emotion, described him as 'mildly autistic'; 'decades after he committed his crimes, Duch is still unable to understand how the behaviorus he values most – dedication to a higher cause, unfailing obedience to superiors, and pride in a job well done – can be entirely wrong.” 

This is worrying, given his mathematical background. As a young man, he had come second in mathematics in the entire country, and had plans to become a professor of mathematics. As regards its influence on his perception of the morality of his own actions later in life, I believe the following quote, from *Man or Monster? The Trial of a Khmer Rouge Torturer* by Alexander Hinton, describing his trial, is rather alarming:

"Duch’s statement was devoted to proving this point, which would minimize his role in the violence. He proceeded by deduction, demonstrating the validity of his conclusion through a series of supporting facts backed by evidence, including CPK slogans and documents. Here his predilection for math converged with law, both of which drew on, but then ultimately stripped away, contextual detail in favour of the abstract (mathematical principles and law) so as to render articulations. Perhaps this similarity was part of the reason he had often seemed at ease in the courtroom, even if his level of comfort was uncanny – as were his final remarks.”

This, I think, shows what can be wrought by the mathematical mind in extreme situations. There was pressure upon him, certainly; indeed, considerably more than there was on Speer. Yet this hardly excuses him. Organisation, efficiency, following orders – all essential parts of the mathematician's mind, and yet all capable of producing horrors beyond belief.
