In a mathematician's career, it often arises that one is ordered by some superior to undertake some mathematically-informed action, whether an apparently abstract problem or something rather more hands-on. While for most of us this will take place within a business structure, it is instructive to consider what happens when mathematicians follow orders without questioning their actions â€“ and why the defence of 'superior orders' doesn't really hold water. 

The Nuremberg Trials are probably the most famous example of this defence; in particular, I discuss the life and actions of Nazi minister (and quasi-mathmo) Albert Speer, as well as the questionable progress of academic mathematical culture in Germany at the time. I explore this more generally in the context of the 'argument from no difference', also examining how the careers of Comrade Duch and John von Neumann relate to mathematics.
